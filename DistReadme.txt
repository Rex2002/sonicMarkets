How to run the SoundInvestments application:

To open the SoundInvestments app, double click on the "SoundInvestments.bat" file in this folder (or "SoundInvestments.command" or "SoundInvestments.bash", whichever is present). This will first open a terminal window and then open the application. Don't close the terminal window as that might close the application as well.
