# SoundInvestments

This is the source code for the "SoundInvestments" project from the lecture SoftwareEngineering II. \
The application aims to support stock analysts by sonifying trade data and thereby enabling a more intuitive understanding of market trends.

## Getting started
Download the newest release, choosing the package for your Operating System (Windows, Arch-based Linux and Apple Silicon macOS are supported). Unpack the zip and, in the resulting directory, open the file named SoundInvestments.bat (or .command on macOS or .bash on Linux). The app opens from there. Don't remove that file from the directory or change the directory's structure in any other way as that might break the app.

## Dive into the code
